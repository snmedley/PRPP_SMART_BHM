# Preference/Response Rate Scenarios
pNP_target = Desired proportion of individuals expressing No Preference in stage 1
pTheta_target = Desired proportion of individuals expressing preference for treatment A among those with a preference in stage 1
pNP2_target = Desired proportion of patients expressing No Preference in stage 2 (among non-responders)
pTheta2_target = Desired proportion of individuals expressing preference for treatment C among those with a preference in stage 2 (among non-responders)
Pa = stage 1 response rate to A among those with no stage 1 preference
Pa1 = stage 1 response rate to A among those with a stage 1 preference
Pb = stage 1 response rate to B among those with no stage 1 preference
Pb1 = stage 1 response rate to B among those with a stage 1 preference

# Preference Augmented DTR Effect Types

muPAR = Expected stage 2 outcomes for responders to A who preferred A
muRAR = Expected stage 2 outcomes for responders to A who were randomized to A
muPBR = Expected stage 2 outcomes for responders to B who preferred B
muRBR = Expected stage 2 outcomes for responders to B who were ranomized to B
muRANRRC = Expected stage 2 outcomes for non-responders to prefer A who prefer C in the second stage
muRANRPC = Expected stage 2 outcomes for non-responders to prefer A who are randomized C in the second stage
muPANRRC = Expected stage 2 outcomes for non-responders to prefer A who prefer D in the second stage
muPANRPC = Expected stage 2 outcomes for non-responders to prefer A who are randomized D in the second stage
and so on...
